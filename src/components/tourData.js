The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical border with Wallachia, on road DN73.Commonly known outside Romania as Dracula s Castle although it is one among several locations linked to the Dracula legend, including Poenari Castle and Hunyadi Castle,it is often erroneously referred to as the home of the title character in Bram Stoker's Dracula.There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, the putative inspiration for Dracula.Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos proposes as location for Castle Dracula an empty mountain top, Mount Izvorul Călimanului, 2,033 metres 6,670 ft high, located in the Călimani Alps near the former border with Moldavia.The castle is now a museum dedicated to displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie.Tourists can see the interior on their own or by a guided tour.
