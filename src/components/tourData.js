      "Castelul Bran is a castle in Bran, 25 kilometres (16 mi) southwest of Brașov. It a national monument and landmark in Romania. The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical border with Wallachia, on road DN73.Commonly known outside Romania as Dracula s Castle although it is one among several locations linked to the Dracula legend, including Poenari Castle and Hunyadi Castle,it is often erroneously referred to as the home of the title character in Bram Stoker's Dracula.There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, the putative inspiration for Dracula.Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos proposes as location for Castle Dracula an empty mountain top, Mount Izvorul Călimanului, 2,033 metres 6,670 ft high, located in the Călimani Alps near the former border with Moldavia.The castle is now a museum dedicated to displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie.Tourists can see the interior on their own or by a guided tour.

      "The fortress was built as part of a defence system for the Transylvanian villages exposed to outside invasions. A decisive aspect for building the fortress at its location was the route of the invading armies which were coming from the Bran pass and were passing through Râșnov, on their way to Braşov and other parts of the Burzenland region. The only chance of survival for the inhabitants of the area, including from Cristian and Ghimbav, was the refuge inside the refuge castle at Râşnov. Compelled to stay there for decades, the people of Râșnov and the nearby villages turned the fortification into their long-term place of residence."
